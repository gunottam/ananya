## 🌞 Daily Morning Routine

### 1. Cleanse
- Mix **besan (gram flour)** with **milk or water**
- Optional: a **pinch of turmeric**
- Massage gently for **2–3 minutes**, rinse with lukewarm water

**Why it works:**  
Absorbs excess oil, cleans pores, gradually fades tan

**Alternatives:**  
- Raw milk rinse  
- Yogurt cleanse

---

### 2. Tone
- Apply **rose water** or **chilled cucumber water**
- Pat dry gently

**Benefits:**  
Soothes skin, reduces redness, refreshes dull complexion

---

### 3. Hydrate
Choose **one**:
- Thin layer of **fresh aloe vera gel** (leave on)
- **Honey mask** for 5–10 minutes, rinse off

---

### 4. Sun Protection (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Apply a **Mineral Sunscreen (Zinc Oxide–based SPF 30+)**
- Optional: physical cover (scarf/cap) *on top*

**Why this matters:**  
Cloth alone does **not** block UVA.  
Without sunscreen, tan reduction stalls completely.

---

## 🌙 Daily Night Routine

### 1. Oil Massage (3–4× / week)
- Use **Almond Oil** or **Hemp Seed Oil**
- Massage gently for **5–10 minutes**
- Skip on active acne days

🚫 **Do NOT use Coconut Oil on the face**  
(Highly comedogenic — clogs pores in oily/combination skin)

---

### 2. Cleanse (Second Wash)
- Besan + yogurt or buttermilk
- Massage gently, rinse well

**Purpose:**  
Removes oil residue without stripping the skin barrier

---

### 3. Exfoliation (1–2× / week ONLY)
- Use **finely soaked oatmeal** + buttermilk/yogurt
- Massage gently for **30–60 seconds**

🚫 **No sugar scrubs**  
Sugar crystals cause micro-tears and barrier damage.

---

### 4. Face Masks (2–3× / week)
Apply for **10–15 minutes**, rinse, moisturize lightly

**Safe Mask Options:**
- **Clay Mask:** Multani mitti + aloe (1× / week)
- **Brightening Mask:** Yogurt + turmeric + *tomato pulp*
- **Hydration Mask:** Milk + honey + saffron

🚫 **No lemon juice on skin**  
(It disrupts pH and causes post-sun pigmentation)

---

### 5. Eye Care (Daily)
- Dab **cold milk or almond oil** under eyes nightly
- 2× / week: chilled cucumber slices or green tea bags
- Optional: saffron soaked in milk (every 2–3 days)

---

### 6. Seal Moisture (If Needed)
- Light layer of almond/hemp oil **or**
- Rose water mist

Avoid heavy creams on oily areas.

Impatience ruins it.
