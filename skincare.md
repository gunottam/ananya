Stop mixing powders daily. Make these two jars and store them in the bathroom.

*Use this every morning instead of face wash.*

* **2 Cups** Besan (Gram Flour)
* **1 Teaspoon** Wild Turmeric (Kasthuri Manjal) – *Regular kitchen turmeric stains; wild doesn't.*
* **Optional:** 2 Tbsp Dried Neem Powder (if acne-prone) or Sandalwood Powder (for fragrance/cooling).
* **Instructions:** Mix all powders dry. Store in an airtight glass jar. Keep away from water.

### 🏺 Jar B: The "Glass Skin" Scrub Base
*Use this 2x a week for exfoliation.*

* **1 Cup** Rolled Oats (Grind them slightly in a mixer so they are coarse powder, not flour).

## 📖 The Recipe Book (Reference)

You don't need to google anything. Here is the source code for every item mentioned above.

#### 🍅 The Tomato Pulp Hack
* **How:** Cut a slice of tomato. Squeeze the juice/pulp directly into your palm with the besan.
* **Why:** Contains Lycopene. It acts as a gentle bleach to remove tan safely.

#### 🥛 Saffron Milk (Kesar)
* **How:** Keep a tiny shot glass in the bathroom. Put 1 tsp milk + 2 strands saffron. Let it sit while you brush your teeth. Apply it like a serum.
* **Why:** The most expensive but most effective step for that "rich" glow.

#### 🥣 Oatmeal Scrub (Jar B)
* **Why:** Sugar tears the skin. Oatmeal contains *saponins* (soaps) and *beta-glucans* (healers). It buffs the skin without scratching it.

#### 🧱 Multani Mitti (Clay)
* **Safety Check:** Never let this dry fully! If it cracks, it sucks moisture OUT of your skin. Wash it while it feels cold and slightly sticky.

## ✅ Final Safety Checks

1.  **Patch Test:** If the Tomato mask stings, wash it off and use plain Yogurt instead.
2.  **No Lemon:** Do not use lemon juice. It messes up your skin's pH and causes dark spots in the sun.
3.  **Consistency:** Use the jars. If the mix is ready, you will actually do it.
