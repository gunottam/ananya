# ✨ The Glow Protocol: Sensitive Edition (V2.0)
### *Non-Comedogenic (Zero Clog) • Oil-Free • Acid-Free*

**Target:** Clear "Glass Skin" without breakouts or irritation.  
**Strict Rule:** 🚫 NO Oils. 🚫 NO Acidic Fruits (Lemon/Tomato).  
**Tech Stack:** 100% Water-Based Hydration & Enzymatic Brightening.

> **💖 For You:** > Since your skin is sensitive and clogs easily, this routine uses "Hydro-Glow" logic: We use moisture (Aloe/Milk) instead of grease (Oils), and Enzymes (Potato) instead of Acids (Tomato).

## ☀️ Morning Routine (Protect)

### 1. The Milk Cleanse 📦
* Take **1 tsp from Jar A**.
* Mix with **Cold Water** or **Rose Water**.
* Massage gently.
* **Why:** Besan pulls out the excess sebum (oil) produced overnight without clogging pores.

### 2. Pore Tightening
* Spray **Chilled Rose Water**.
* Let it air dry on the face.

### 3. Oil-Free Hydration
* Apply **99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel**.
* *Tip:* Keep your Aloe Gel in the fridge. The cold constricts pores and reduces puffiness.

### 4. The Shield 🛡️
* **Gel-Based or Mineral Sunscreen (SPF 50)**.
* *Important:* Look for "Non-Comedogenic" on the label.

## 🌙 Night Routine (Repair)

### 1. The "Anti-Clog" Cleanse (Make-up/Sunscreen Removal)
* **Step 1:** Dip a cotton pad in **Cold Raw Milk**. Wipe your face thoroughly.
    * *Why:* Milk fats bind to dirt/makeup gently without adding pore-clogging grease.
* **Step 2:** Wash with **Jar A + Water**.

### 2. The Hydro-Massage (Instead of Oil)
* Apply a thick layer of **Aloe Vera Gel**.
* Massage face upwards for 5 minutes.
* *Why:* This drains lymph fluids and gives you the "facial massage" glow without using a drop of oil.

### 3. The Treatment (Follow Weekly Schedule)
* Apply the specific mask for the night.

### 4. Under-Eye Care
* Place **Cucumber Slices** or **Cold Potato Slices** on eyes for 5 mins.
* Rinse and sleep.

## 📖 The "Why" (Logic)

#### 🥔 The Potato Hack (Replaces Tomato)
* **How:** Grate a small piece of potato. Squeeze the juice into your Besan (Jar A).
* **Why:** Potato contains an enzyme called *Catecholase*. It is a powerful natural bleach that removes tan and dark circles *without* the acidity that irritates sensitive skin.

#### 🥛 The Raw Milk Cleanser (Replaces Oil)
* **Why:** Since oils clog your pores, Milk is the perfect substitute. It contains natural lipids that dissolve surface dirt, but it washes off completely with water, leaving zero residue.

#### 🧊 Aloe Vera Massage (Replaces Oil Massage)
* **Why:** You can massage your face with gel just as well as oil. It provides the "slip" needed to sculpt the face, but it absorbs as water, leaving your skin hydrated and plump, not greasy.

## ✅ Final Safety Checks

1.  **No Coconut/Almond/Sesame:** We have removed all oils. Your hydration comes from Aloe, Honey, and Yogurt.
2.  **No Lemon/Tomato:** We use Potato and Turmeric for brightening. Zero stinging.
3.  **Sanitize:** Since we aren't using strong cleansers, make sure your pillowcase is changed every 2-3 days to prevent clogging from dust.
