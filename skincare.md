## ☀️ Morning Protocol (The "Protect" Phase)

### 1. The Gentle Cleanse
**Besan (Gram Flour) + Raw Milk**
* Mix a tablespoon of besan with enough milk to make a paste.
* *Optional:* Add a tiny pinch of turmeric.
* Massage gently onto damp face for 60 seconds.
* **✨ Pro Tip:** Remove with a **soft, damp muslin cloth** instead of just splashing water. This acts as a micro-polisher for smooth texture.

### 2. Tone & Awaken
**Pure Rose Water (Gulab Jal)**
* Spray generously or dab with a cotton pad.
* Let it air dry slightly.

### 3. Hydrate
**Fresh Aloe Vera Gel**
* Apply a thin, breathable layer.
* Acts as a primer and seals moisture without oil.

### 4. The Non-Negotiable Shield 🛡️
**Mineral Sunscreen (SPF 30+)**
* **Rule:** Even if you are inside. Even if it is cloudy.
* This is the *only* step that actually stops dark spots and tanning.
* *Zinc Oxide* formulas are best for sensitive/oily skin.

## 🌙 Night Protocol (The "Repair" Phase)

### 1. Oil Dissolve (3-4x Weekly)
**Sweet Almond Oil OR Hemp Seed Oil**
* Massage dry face for 5 minutes to dissolve sebum and sunscreen.
* 🚫 **Stay Away:** No Coconut Oil (it clogs pores).

### 2. The Second Cleanse
**Besan + Yogurt/Curd**
* Wash away the oil and impurities.
* The lactic acid in yogurt gently exfoliates dead cells while you wash.

### 3. The Royal Treatment (See Schedule)
* Apply your specific mask for the night (listed below).
* Leave on for **10–15 minutes**.

### 4. Luxe Eye Care
**Saffron (Kesar) + Milk**
* Dip your ring finger in saffron-infused milk and dab under eyes.
* Reduces dark circles and brightens the under-eye area naturally.

## 🧪 The "Bug-Free" Safety Rules (Read Carefully)

#### 1. The Clay Mask Rule ⚠️
When using **Multani Mitti**, do **not** let it dry until it cracks.
* **Wrong:** Waiting until it's hard like cement (causes wrinkles/dehydration).
* **Right:** Wash it off when it is sticky/tacky (about 80% dry).

#### 2. The Tomato Patch Test 🍅
Tomato is a great gentle bleach (better than lemon), but it can tingle.
* Test a small amount on your neck first. If it burns, swap it for plain Yogurt.

#### 3. No Sugar, No Tears 🚫
We use **Oatmeal**, not Sugar.
* Sugar creates micro-tears in the skin. Soaked oatmeal contains *saponins* which clean pores without scratching.

## 🌿 Ingredient Intelligence

* **Besan:** The ultimate cleanser. Pulls oil but keeps healthy fats.
* **Turmeric:** Anti-inflammatory. Fades scars. (Use a tiny pinch to avoid staining).
* **Yogurt:** Natural chemical exfoliation (Lactic Acid). Smooths texture.
* **Saffron:** The glow luxury. Rich in antioxidants.
* **Almond Oil:** High in Vitamin E. Non-comedogenic (won't clog).

---

## ⏳ The Timeline

* **Week 1-4:** Detox phase. Skin feels cleaner, less oily.
* **Week 5-8:** Brightening phase. Tan begins to fade, tone evens out.
* **Week 9-12:** The "Glass" phase. Texture becomes hyper-smooth and reflects light.
