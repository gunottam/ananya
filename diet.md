## EXECUTION NOTES
1. **Rice Volume:** 150g cooked rice is not a huge amount visually. Do not over-serve yourself. Use a weighing scale if possible.
2. **Fiber is Key:** Since you aren't eating Roti (which has fiber), you **must** eat the salad. If you skip salad, you will get hungry within 2 hours of eating rice.
3. **Oil Usage:** Use a spray or measure 1 teaspoon per meal max.
4. **Water:** Drink 4–5 Liters daily to keep metabolic rate high.
