## 👨‍🍳 THE "MAKE IT TASTY" RECIPES

### 1. DORM ROOM MASALA CHICKEN (The Bulk Cook)
*Cook this on Sunday & Thursday. Makes ~4 servings.*

**Ingredients per batch:**
- 1.2 kg Chicken Breast (cut into 1-inch cubes)
- 3 Large Onions (Finely chopped)
- 3 Tomatoes (Chopped small)
- 2 tbsp Ginger-Garlic Paste
- Spices: 1 tsp Haldi, 1 tsp Chili Powder, **3 tbsp Chicken Masala** (Be generous)
- 2 tbsp Oil
- Salt to taste
- 1 Lemon

**Steps:**
1. **Heat:** Put pot on Induction (Medium heat - 800/1000W). Add oil.
2. **The Base (Critical Step):** Add chopped onions. Fry them until they turn **Brown** (not pink, brown). This takes 8-10 mins. Do not skip this or chicken will taste bland.
3. **Aromatics:** Add Ginger-Garlic paste. Stir for 1 minute until raw smell goes.
4. **Masala:** Add tomatoes + Salt + Haldi + Chili + Chicken Masala. Cook until tomatoes are mushy and oil separates slightly.
5. **Meat:** Dump in the chicken cubes. Mix well so every piece is coated in red masala.
6. **Cook:** Add a *very small* splash of water (chicken releases its own water). Cover with lid.
7. **Simmer:** Lower heat (400/600W). Let it cook for 15-20 mins.
8. **Finish:** Check if chicken is soft. Squeeze 1 whole lemon on top. Mix. Done.

### 2. PERFECT BOILED RICE (Batch Cook)
*Cook this Sunday & Thursday (or Wed if you run out).*

3. **Boil:** Put rice and water in pot. Turn induction to High.
4. **Simmer:** Once water starts boiling, turn induction to Low (200/400W). Cover with lid.
5. **Wait:** Let it cook for 10-12 mins.
6. **Check:** If water is gone and rice is fluffy, it's done.
