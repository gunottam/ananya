## ♨️ HOW TO REHEAT & PACK LUNCH (CRITICAL)
*Cold rice from the fridge is hard and dry. You MUST reheat properly.*

**Method 1: If you have a Common Microwave**
1. Put chicken and rice in tiffin.
2. Sprinkle roughly **2 tablespoons of water** over the rice (Do not skip this).
3. Microwave for 2 minutes. The water turns to steam and makes the rice soft again.

**Method 2: The Induction Pan Method (Your Setup)**
1. **Heat:** Put your pot on the induction (Medium heat).
2. **Liquid:** Add a very small splash of water (about 3-4 tbsp) to the empty pot. Let it sizzle.
3. **Dump:** Throw in your portion of Cold Rice + Cold Chicken.
4. **Steam:** Cover with the lid immediately. Let it steam for 2 minutes.
5. **Mix:** Open lid, stir everything together. The rice should be fluffy now.
6. **Pack:** Transfer to your tiffin.

*Pro-Tip:* Do this **before** making your breakfast oats so you don't have to wash the pot twice aggressively. Just rinse it after packing lunch, then make oats.

## ⚠️ SURVIVAL RULES
1. **The Cucumber Rule:** You must eat the cucumber with lunch. No roti = less fiber. If you skip salad, you will get constipated.
2. **Water:** Drink 4 Liters. High protein dehydrates you.
3. **Spoilage:** If chicken smells sour or slimy on Thursday, throw it out. (Keep fridge setting to 'Coldest').
